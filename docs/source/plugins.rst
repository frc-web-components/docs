Plugins
=======

Plugins are used to extend the functionality of the FRC Web Components dashboard. The main components that can be extended are:

**Elements**
   These are UI components like buttons, line charts and robot visualizations that are used to build dashboards. Users have the option of adding their own custom elements in addition to the ones that ship with the dashboard.
**Source Providers**
   Source providers are what provide data to your elements, such as NetworkTables and Camera Streams. You can create your own Source providers to provide additional sources of data to your elements.
